# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This repository contains provisioning templates for Vast.ai GPU instances, specifically designed for setting up ComfyUI environments. The main script `default.sh` handles automated installation of packages, ComfyUI nodes, and AI models.

## Architecture

The provisioning system is built around a single bash script that:
- Activates a Python virtual environment at `/venv/main`
- Downloads and installs ComfyUI custom nodes from GitHub
- Downloads AI models from Hugging Face and CivitAI
- Manages authentication tokens for model downloads
- Provides arrays for easy configuration of:
  - APT packages
  - Python packages
  - ComfyUI nodes
  - AI models (checkpoints, LoRA, VAE, ControlNet, etc.)

## Key Patterns

1. **Model Organization**: Models are downloaded to specific ComfyUI subdirectories based on type (checkpoints, unet, lora, controlnet, vae, esrgan)
2. **Token Authentication**: Supports both `HF_TOKEN` for Hugging Face and `CIVITAI_TOKEN` for CivitAI downloads
3. **Auto-update**: Nodes can be automatically updated if `AUTO_UPDATE` is not set to "false"
4. **Provisioning Control**: Users can disable provisioning by creating `/.noprovisioning` file

## Usage

To use this template:
1. Uncomment and add desired items to the configuration arrays at the top of `default.sh`
2. Add model URLs to the appropriate model arrays
3. Set environment variables `HF_TOKEN` and/or `CIVITAI_TOKEN` if downloading from authenticated sources
4. The script will run automatically on container start unless disabled

## GUI Tool

A GUI application (`provisioning_gui.py`) is provided to simplify creating provisioning scripts:

### Status: âœ… Fixed
- Fixed KeyError with WORKSPACE bash variable by properly escaping template strings
- Fixed AttributeError by adding initialization guard in update_preview method
- GUI now launches successfully and functions as intended

### Features:
- Visual interface for managing all provisioning arrays
- Add/remove URLs and packages with ease
- Paste multiple URLs at once
- Preview generated script in real-time
- Save scripts to file
- Upload directly to Git repository

### Usage:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install PySide6

# Run the GUI
python provisioning_gui.py
```

### GUI Workflow:
1. Launch the GUI application
2. Use tabs to navigate between different model categories
3. Paste or type URLs/packages in the input area
4. Click "Add" to include them in the script
5. Preview the generated script on the right
6. Save to file or upload directly to Git

The GUI automatically loads `default.sh` on startup if present, allowing you to edit existing provisioning scripts.
